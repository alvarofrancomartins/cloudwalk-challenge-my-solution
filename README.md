# CloudWalk Challenge 

This is my solution for this challenge.

1. Data analysis for Problem 3.1 is in the CloudWalk_Data_Analysis_(Checkout).ipynb notebook.
2. Data analysis for Problem 3.2 is in the CloudWalk_Data_Analysis_(Transactions).ipynb notebook. 
3. My thought process of creating the simple Monitoring Alert System can be see in the Monitoring Alert System Development.ipynb notebook. 

To run the simulation of the Monitoring Alert System, you can simply run

```python
python3 monitoring.py 'transactions_1' 100
```

The first arg is which csv we run the monitoring (which can be either transactions_1 or transactions_2). The second argument is the interval (Delay between frames in milliseconds) of the Matplotlib animation. 

I run this on my Ubuntu terminal.

I have also prepared two videos showing the monitoring for [transactions_1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw_pp2OyI8M) and [transactions_2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlueZKk-LIk).
